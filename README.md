Below is an illustrative end-to-end example showing how you might integrate the PE crossbar code (for 16‑bit nibble‑based multiplication) into a pipelined YOLOv8s inference flow on a system with multiple PEs, static XY routing, and a 2D mesh topology. Because a true YOLOv8s implementation is very large (dozens of layers, with residual connections and multi‑scale heads), the code below is a conceptual / toy prototype. It demonstrates how pipeline scheduling (Stages S0–S4) can be combined with PE crossbar multiplication in a manner that meets the approximate target of ~30 ms latency for 640×640 input, given 5–8 PEs, 500 MHz–1 GHz clock, and ~28.6 GFLOPs total compute.

The goal is to show where in the pipeline your existing PE crossbar code slots in (specifically in the convolution stages), as well as how intermediate results flow stage by stage. This also demonstrates double‑buffering and how bounding box decode / NMS can run after the main convolution layers have finished.

High‐Level Outline
Stage 0: Load or fetch input image tiles (S0).
Stage 1: Convolution on Crossbar PEs (S1).
Stage 2: Activation (ReLU / LeakyReLU) (S2).
Stage 3: Inter‐layer transfer (and possibly partial results to next layer) (S3).
Stage 4: Non‐maximum suppression (NMS) and bounding box decode (S4).
Below, we illustrate:

How your “PE crossbar multiplication” code is used to simulate each convolution layer.
A pipeline simulation that schedules multiple chunks (tiles) of data in parallel.
We assume a simplified YOLOv8s with just two convolution layers plus the final detection layer that outputs bounding boxes. (A real YOLOv8s has many more, but this is sufficient to show the pipeline approach.)
Explanation
Crossbar Setup (Section A):

You load a 32×8 array of 16‑bit weights, split each 16‑bit weight into four 4‑bit nibbles, and store them in a 32×32 matrix.
The function crossbar_conv_16bitMAC(input_stream_16bit) simulates the full cross terms multiplication for each row’s 16‑bit input versus the row’s 16‑bit weight, using nibble decomposition. This is effectively your PE code in a neat function.
Pipeline Simulation (Section B):

We define a toy pipeline with 5 “chunks” per image, plus 2 convolution layers and final detection.
Stages 0–3 handle input fetch, convolution, activation, and data transfer. Stage 4 handles bounding box decode and NMS.
We assign each stage a nominal time (t0–t4) in cycles (abstract units).
We orchestrate them in a loop, illustrating double-buffering with pending_chunk. The pipeline ensures that once Stage1 is done with a chunk, Stage0 can fetch the next chunk, and so on, with minimal stalling.
For each chunk, we run:
Layer1 (Conv + ReLU), then Transfer,
Layer2 (Conv + LeakyReLU), then Transfer to detection.
Finally, after all chunks, we do detection + NMS (Stage4).
The concurrency is reflected in the timeline (similar to your pipeline code). Stages can overlap across chunks so that, e.g., Stage1 might be computing chunk 2 while Stage2 is activating chunk 1.
Real YOLOv8s vs. Demo Code:

A real YOLOv8s has many more conv layers, residual connections, upsample operations, and multi‑scale detection heads. You’d replicate the pipeline concept for each conv or processing stage, with each one assigned to the crossbar code.
The final detection stage is simplified here; real YOLOv8 includes more heads, each producing bounding boxes at different scales. Post‑processing merges them, applies NMS, etc.
Nonetheless, the same principle (pipelined chunking, or tiling) extends to the entire model. Each layer’s weights are loaded on the crossbar (or sets of crossbars if multiple PEs). The pipeline orchestrates data movement so that every PE is kept busy, maximizing throughput.

3. Estimating Performance vs. 30 ms Target
YOLOv8s requires ~28.6 GFLOPs for a 640×640 input.
At 500 MHz (worst case) with 5–8 PEs, you can approach tens of billions of MACs per second if everything is fully pipelined (all crossbar PEs busy). For instance, at 500 MHz × 256 parallel MACs per crossbar = 128 GMAC/s per PE, times 5 PEs = 640 GMAC/s peak, i.e. 0.64 TOPS. This is borderline to meet 28.6 GFLOPs in ~30 ms (which needs ~0.953 TFLOPs). But with more PEs or a faster clock (1 GHz, 8+ PEs), you can surpass 1 TOPS to comfortably hit ~30 ms.
The pipeline ensures minimal idle time on the crossbar. Double‑buffering ensures data fetch overlaps with compute. Summarily, you can expect near peak utilization.
The post‑processing (NMS) is relatively small, especially once the bounding boxes are pruned (a few hundred boxes at most). It typically doesn’t hurt overall throughput because it can overlap with the next image’s convolution.
Thus, with an adequate number of PEs (scale beyond 8 if needed), 1 GHz clock, and efficient pipeline scheduling (as demonstrated), you can approach or beat ~30 ms latency for YOLOv8s. The code above gives a template for how to integrate your crossbar multiplication approach into a full pipelined flow.

Key Takeaways
Your PE Crossbar Code (the nibble-based 16-bit MAC) is plugged into the pipeline as the convolution engine (Stage1).
Multiple Layers simply re-run your crossbar logic with different weights (mapping each layer’s weights into the 32×32 crossbar or across multiple crossbars / PEs).
Pipelined Scheduling with S0–S3 ensures continuous data movement and concurrency, while Stage4 handles bounding box post-processing.
Double-Buffering prevents the crossbar from stalling, and chunk-based tiling ensures memory usage is manageable.
Scaling PEs, clock speed, or parallel crossbars can bring throughput to the level required for real-time YOLOv8.
This combined code plus diagram demonstrates how you can implement a “full” YOLO pipeline (in simplified form) on your system, using pipeline scheduling for each stage and your crossbar PE code to handle the actual 16-bit MAC operations for each convolution layer.
